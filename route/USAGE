Description:
    Creates a new AngularJS route

Example:
    yo angular-feature:route thing [--coffee] [--minsafe]

    This will create (division by component):
        app/scripts/controllers/thing.js
        app/views/thing.html
    and add routing to:
        app.js

    or (division by feature):
    	app/src/common/controllers/thing.js
        app/src/common/views/thing.html
    and add routing to:
        app.js


    yo angular-feature:route foo/thing [--coffee] [--minsafe]

    This will create (division by feature):
        app/src/foo/controllers/thing.js
        app/src/foo/views/thing.html
    and add routing to:
        app.js


    yo angular-feature:route foo/bar/thing [--coffee] [--minsafe]

    This will create (division by feature):
        app/src/foo/bar/controllers/thing.js
        app/src/foo/bar/views/thing.html
    and add routing to:
        app.js
